Philip Roberts: What the heck is the event loop anyway?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ

the call stack
one thread == one call stack == one thing at a time

blowing the stack
function foo () {
    return foo();
}
    * This will keep calling the foo function, which causes a blowing of the stack.

blocking - What happens when things are slow?
    * solution - asynchronous callbacks

Concurrency & the Event loop
    * One thing at a time, except not really.

Call Stack, Web APIs, Callback Queue, Eventloop

Render Queue is given a higher priority than the Callback Queue.
